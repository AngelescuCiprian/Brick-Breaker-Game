This is a 16 bit application so to make a  16-bit applications run on windows10/11, you need to install dosbox or vDOS application. You can run the program through Dosbox which comes with Turboc++:

# Brick Breaker - Turbo C++

A classic "Brick Breaker" game developed in C using Turbo C++.

## üìú Description
This project is a simple retro-style game, built using the `graphics.h` library from Turbo C++. The objective of the game is to break at least 8 bricks to win.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play?
- Use the **left/right arrow keys** to move the paddle.
- The ball moves automatically, and you must break the bricks.
- If you lose the ball, the game is over.
- To win, you need to break at least **8 bricks**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements
- Turbo C++ (DOSBox may be required on modern systems)
- Graphics card compatible with Turbo C++
- Operating System: Windows XP or older (or use DOSBox for emulation)

## üîß Installation & Running
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AngelescuCiprian/Brick-BreakerGame.git
2.
  Open Turbo C++ and load the brick_breaker.c file.
3.
  Compile and run the code.
This project uses old Turbo C++ functions (graphics.h, conio.h, dos.h), which are not supported in modern compilers. To run it on modern systems, it is recommended to use a DOS emulator like DOSBox.
